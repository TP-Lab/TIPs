# TP Improvement Proposals (TIPs)
TP Improvement Proposals (TIPs) describe standards for TP, including protocol specifications and APIs. Browse all current and draft TIPs on the official TIP site.

# Project Goal
The TP Improvement Proposals repository exists as a place to share concrete proposals with potential users of the proposal and the Ethereum community at large.
Here anyone can publish their own suggestions and formulate corresponding agreement rules, and each opinion will be taken seriously by the TP team. Developers can also quickly access existing protocols to better serve users.
