## <a name='summary'></a>Overview
TIP-001 is a proposal of adding DApp to TokenPocket. Developers could use this proposal to add Dapp to TokenPocket easily and quickly

## <a name='usage'></a>How to use
First you have to build data of DApp Json, and then add DApp to TokenPocket through Deeklink, tp-js-sdk or QR Code

DApp Json structure as following：（detailed introduction below）
```
{
	"title": "Etherscan",
	"url": "https://etherscan.io/",
	"icon_url": "https://etherscan.io/images/logo-ether.png?v=0.0.2",
	"protocol": "TIP-001",
	"protocol_version": "1.0",
	"chain_list": [{
		"network": "ethereum",
		"chain_id": "1"
	}],
	"desc": "Etherscan is a Block Explorer and Analytics Platform for Ethereum, a decentralized smart contracts platform",
	"full_screen": 0,
	"hori_vert": 0,
	"title_color": "0xffffff",
	"navi_color": "0x2890fe"
}
```

## <a name='add'></a>How to add DApp to TokenPocket

#### Method 1：Deeplink
1.Build URL**tpdiscover://add?params=..**, params' value is DApp Json. Note: you need to decode json subject, below is result：

```
tpdiscover://add?params=%7B%22title%22%3A%20%22Etherscan%22%2C%22url%22%3A%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fetherscan.io%2F%22%2C%22icon_url%22%3A%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fetherscan.io%2Fimages%2Flogo-ether.png%3Fv%3D0.0.2%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%20%22TIP-001%22%2C%22protocol_version%22%3A%20%221.0%22%2C%22chain_list%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22desc%22%3A%20%22Etherscan%20is%20a%20Block%20Explorer%20and%20Analytics%20Platform%20for%20Ethereum%2C%20a%20decentralized%20smart%20contracts%20platform%22%2C%22full_screen%22%3A%200%2C%22hori_vert%22%3A%200%2C%22title_color%22%3A%20%220xffffff%22%2C%22navi_color%22%3A%20%220x2890fe%22%7D
```

2.Use on the web

```
<a href="tpdiscover://add?params=...">Add DApp to TokenPocket</a>
```


#### Method 2：tp-js-sdk
After built data of DApp Json, call tp-js-sdk's function: addDAppToDiscover**


#### Method 3：QR Code
After built data of DApp Json, generated the QR code, click the up right conner to scan on TokenPocket.


## <a name='dapp'></a>About DApp JSON
DApp JSON structure as follow:
- `title`: `String`
- `url`: `String`
- `icon_url`: `String`
- `protocol`: `String`
- `protocol_version`: `String`
- `chain_list`: `Array`
- `desc`: `String`
- `full_screen`: `Integer`
- `hori_vert`: `Integer`
- `title_color`: `String`
- `navi_color`: `String`

among them**title**，**url** and **icon_url** are required option to fill，when using QR code，**protocol** is also required option to fill，and other options are optional to fill

chain_list structure as follow：
- `chain_list`: `Array`
    - `network` : `Stirng`
    - `chain_id` : `String`
    - `ss58` : `String`

Introductions of each field：
- title: DApp's title(name)
- url: DApp's URL
- icon_url: DApp logo's URL
- protocol: TIP，such as TIP-001
- protocol_version: version number of protocol. If protocol upgrade from 1.0 to 2.0, it requied ungrade accordingly.
- chain_list: point out which chain is available for the DApp, such as DApp support Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, HECO; When it is empty, then no limitation, which means support all chains
- desc: DApp's describe text
- full_screen: Full screen or not，1 means full screen，0 means not full screen
- hori_vert: Landscape or not，0 means portrait screen, 1 means landscape mode
- title_color: when DApp under not full screen mode, will display navigation bar, it used to appoint the font color of navigation bar (when under full screen mode, then this field is invalid)
- navi_color: when DApp under not full screen mode, will display navigation bar, it used to appoint the background color of navigation bar (when under full screen mode, then this field is invalid)

#### How to use chain_list
**chain_list** is used to point out which chain is available for the DApp, such as DApp support Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, HECO; When it is empty, then no limitation, which means support all chains
1.Appoint EVM Chain. When need to appoint DApp is support Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, HECO, the field as follow

```
[{
		"network": "ethereum",
		"chain_id": "1"
	},
	{
		"network": "ethereum",
		"chain_id": "56"
	},
	{
		"network": "ethereum",
		"chain_id": "128"
	}
]
```
differentiate throughchain_id，it apply to all EVM chain

2.Appoint network like Tron, Solana, ect. Differentiate chain through the symbol of native token

```
[{
	"network": "SOL"
}, {
	"network": "TRX"
}]
```

3.Appoint Polkadot series chain. Differentiate chain throughss58

```
[{
	"network": "polkadot",
	"ss58": "0"
}, {
	"network": "polkadot",
	"ss58": "2"
}, {
	"network": "polkadot",
	"ss58": "27"
}]
```
